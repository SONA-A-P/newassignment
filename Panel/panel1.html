    <div class="panel-footer"><p></p>Sakthan Thampuran Palace once belonged to the Perumpadappu Swaroopam,
         the ruling dynasty of Kochi. This was the centre of power of King Rama Varma Sakthan Thampuran,
          who ruled Kochi between AD 1790 and 1805. His rule was regarded as the Golden Era of the Cochin dynasty. 
          The palace is close to the Vadakkumnathan Temple in Thrissur. Saktan Thampuran is credited with the introduction of the Thrissur Pooram festival, 
          an annual festival in May with teams representing the Parmekavu Bhagavathy temple and Tiruvambadi Krishna temple competing for primacy in front of
           the Vadakkumnathan temple with elephants, percussion, drums, fireworks, etc. The palace was once known as
            Vadakkechira Kovilakam and it was the king who renovated it into the present form.
             The palace keeps with it the historical remnants of some important events like 
             the visit of Tipu Sultan with his army. The last member of the royal family to reside here was
              Rama Varma Bharathan Thampuran, a grand nephew of Chowwarayil Theepetta Veliyathampuran.
              The palace has a very old Sarpakavu (sacred serpent grove) in its premises.</p></div>
